    "# Maximum Gift Exchange Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "A model designed to explore the impact of different gift exchange rules (e.g. White Elephant, Green Grinch, etc.). The primary goal is to find the rules that lead to maximum chaos, as defined as maximum number of gift steals (possibly -- probably? -- within some time constraint)."

    "## Gift Exchange Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model a gift exchange as a game with an equal number of `G` `gifts` and `P` `players`. Players `value` each gift according to their personal preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Rule Variants\n",
    "Some gift exchange variants use slightly different rules. These variants can be mixed and matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional end-game swapping\n",
    "This variant adds extra swaps at the end of the game after `p1` makes their swap. If `p1` does swap with another player's gift, that player becomes active and repeats step 4, and so on until the active player elects not to swap or there are no more eligible gifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### All gifts start unwrapped\n",
    "In this variant, all gifts in the pool are unwrapped. This means that, instead of players learning their preferences as gifts are opened, all players have complete information about their gift preferences throughout the entire game.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Per-round stealing constraints\n",
    "- A gift can only be stolen `St` times per round, regardless of who is doing the stealing. In other words, once a gift is stolen within a given round, it is ineligble for the remainder of that round.\n",
    "- No more than `Sg` gifts can be stolen per round. Once `Sg` is reached, the round concludes and a new round begins by the next player becoming active in step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Per-player stealing constraints\n",
    "In this variant, there is also a cap on the number of times `Sp` each *player* can be stolen from. For example, once a given player `Sp_n` has been stolen from `Sp_n = Sp` times, the gift they hold at that point is now ineligible. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### No gift stealing constraint\n",
    "In this variant, there is no cap on the number of times a given gift can be stolen. In other words, `S = infinity`."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "### Gift Values\n",
    "Players have personal preferences and value gifts accordingly. Each `player` has a (potentially) unique subjective `subj_value` for each `gift`. We can therefore model gift subjective value as a `G` by `P` matrix of values `subj_value_gp in range(100)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we allow for the notion that some gifts are objectively better than others (almost all gifts will be valued higher than a spray-painted tamborine, for example), we can model `subj_value` as normally distributed variance around a common `obj_value` level. "

    "Each player brings one gift to the game and leaves with a (typically) different gift.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game begins with all gifts wrapped, i.e. each player knows the content of only the gift they brought and none other.\n",
    "\n",
    "A player order is determined (by some arbitrary method, e.g. random).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first player `p1` selects one of the gifts from the set of unwrapped gifts and opens it.\n",
    "2. The next player `p2` is now active, and has the option to either:\n",
    "    1. Open a gift from the pool, leading to a repeat of step 2 with `p3` active\n",
    "    2. Steal an eligible open gift, leading to a repeat of step 2 with `p1` active\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 until all gifts have been opened (i.e. there are no gifts remaining in the pool).\n",
    "4. `p1` is now active again and has the option to (forcibly) swap with another player for their eligible gift. The game ends once `p1` has swapped or decided to not swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new **round** begins when a new gift is opened from the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stealing\n",
    "- Each gift can only be stolen up to `gift_steals_cap` times, including swaps. A given gift `G_n` is eligible for stealing (or swapping) while `gift_steals_n < gift_steals_cap`. For example, when `gift_steals_cap = 3`, each gift can only be stolen 3 times. After that, the gift is no longer eligible and no player may steal it or swap for it; a player holding an ineligible gift will leave the game with that gift.\n",
    "- Within a given round, gifts cannot be stolen back by the player who began the turn holding that gift.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. If they do not swap, the game ends.\n",
    "    2. If they do swap with another player, step 4 repeats with that swapped player active"
